# conditional-clip

conditional-clip is a model that modulates the image embedding of CLIP by an external context. This could be useful for:

- VQA: The image embedding is modulated by a question, such that the resulting vector lives near the answers.
- Referring Expressions: The image embedding is modulated by an expression, such that the resulting vector primarly captures the contents of the expression.
